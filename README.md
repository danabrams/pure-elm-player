# pure-elm-player

This is an attempt to build a pure elm video player -- no ports, no web components, no kernel code

There are many things that would be better about it if using ports, web components, or ideally, an elm-exploration with kernel code, but I think I can show just how we can create a declarative API for this so that anyone attempting to do those things has a better starting point.
